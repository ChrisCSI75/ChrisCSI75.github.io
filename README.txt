A North-East, newly self-taught developer and programmer.  If you need a small website put together for 
a local club or charity etc please let me know.  

Open and honest (I won't be building anything like the next Amazon site anytime soon (read: ever) but I can
 put together a small, custom built site for smaller companies who want a bigger presence on the web.

E.g., you run a local chess/tennis/sports club, a local charity, a small family business looking to draw 
attention online.  

While there are numerous content management systems/website builders out there, try making something that can 
let you stand out from the crowd.  If you already have your own ideas/designs/colours for how you want your 
site to look then all the btter, let me take those ideas and put them into practice for you!

Website was built using pure html5, CSS3 and JavaScript, no plugins, no management systems, no shortcuts!

I started out building little 2D games with Phaser 3 and little web games in HTML for my daughter and
realised how much I enjoyed doing this.  Far from a designer or developer by trade, I'd be happy to let 
you know if I think I can help you out or not.  My skillset is developing all the time and if there is 
something I can't do I'll either learn it to get your project finished, or I'll be straight up if it is 
beyond my skillset.
